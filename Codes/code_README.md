(1) code file: drop 11 columns and all the rows contain 'null' callsign from (1) dataset, find and remove all 'helicopter'
              callsigns (using a self-implemented function to request and extract information from "https://www.flightaware.com/resources/registration/{callsign}"
              for each callsign), and reduce the orginal sampling rate to half

(2) code file: remove flight segments that are shorter than 1 minute or longer than 30 minutes

(3) code file: extract the data of flight record N86HD-abcd31

(4) code file: train and test different models on the data of flight record N86HD-abcd31
